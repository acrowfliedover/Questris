# Questris
Tetris with quest
In order to push online...I had to overwrite my readme...and I did not save the old readme, so here is the update.
This project is aiming to create a functional tetris game via Qt. This project takes would take much more time and effort than I expected. This project is probably not finished on time but would update. It would contain only functions and classes that would be useful for the game, by the time of this readme written.

Extra features for later.
